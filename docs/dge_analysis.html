Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/DRMCRL/MFM-223_DHT-RNASeq/tree/add37509839c01867c73820a452858de979049f2" target="_blank">add3750</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  100Day_Cancer_Free.png

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<p>
These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/dge_analysis.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/dge_analysis.html</code>) files. If you’ve configured a remote Git repository (see <code>?wflow_git_remote</code>), click on the hyperlinks in the table below to view the files as they were in that past version.

<p>This data set is slightly unique in that samples were sequenced across multiple lanes and flowcells. Metadata was re-organised to enable summarising of counts across the multiple sequencing runs obtained for every sample. The <a href="qc_aligned.html#pca">initial PCA</a> showed that variability between replicates and flowcells was dwarfed by variability between samples. As such, all counts were able to be merged to give a single set of counts for each individual sample.</p>
<p>Importantly, <strong>no control (Vehicle) sample was found for replicate 2</strong> and if using a nested approach this treated sample may need to be omitted</p>

<p>Given that previous work had only assessed the libraries prior to merging, the library sizes were checked after merging replicate sequencing runs. The median library size was found to be 13.3 million reads which is just above the common-use minimum recommendation of 10 million reads/sample.</p>
<p>However, samples MFM3-D and MFM4-D were both below the common-use minimum library size.</p>

<div id="checks-for-gc-and-length-bias" class="section level2">
<h2>Checks for GC and Length bias</h2>
<p>Given the clear unexpected variability captured by PC1, the impact of GC content or length bias was assessed as a possible source.</p>
<p>Genes were divided in 10 approximately equal sized bins based on increasing length, and 10 approximately equal sized bins based on increasing GC content, with the final GC/Length bins being the combination 100 bins using both sets. The contribution of each gene to PC1 and PC2 was assessed and a t-test performed on each bin. This tests</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H_0: \mu = 0 \text{ against } H_A: \mu \neq 0
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> represents the true contribution to PC1 of all genes in that bin.</p>
<p>If any bin makes a contribution to PC1 the mean will be clearly non-zero, whilst if there is no contribution the mean will be near zero. In this way, the impact of gene length and GC content on variance within the dataset can be assessed. As seen below, the contribution of GC content and gene length to PC1 is very clear, with a smaller contribution being evident across PC2. As a result, Conditional Quantile Normalisation (<code>CQN</code>) is recommended in preference to the more common TMM normalisation.</p>

<p>CQN clearly had a positive impact on the data, however, replicate 2 was removed in order to allow the use of a blocking approach, where an individual baseline level is set for each untreated sample and the common difference between vehicle and DHT-treated is then found.</p>

<p>In order to detect genes which respond to DHT the Null Hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) was specified to be a range around zero, instead of the conventional point-value.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H_0: -\lambda \leq \mu \leq \lambda \\
\text{Vs.} \\
H_A: |\mu| &gt; \lambda
\]</span></p>
<p>This characterises <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> as being a range instead of being the singularity 0, with <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> representing the true mean logFC. The default value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = \log_2 1.2 = 0.263\)</span> was chosen. This removes any requirement for <em>post hoc</em> filtering based on logFC. Using this approach, 856 genes were considered as DE to an FDR of 0.05. Of these, 384 were up-regulated with the remaining 472 being down-regulated.</p>
